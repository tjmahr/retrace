[![Project Status: Suspended - Initial development has started, but there has not 
yet been a stable, usable release; work has been stopped for the time being but the 
author(s) intend on resuming work.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/suspended.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#suspended)

A pure R implementation of the TRACE model of word recognition (McClelland &
Elman, 1986). 

I wrote the package so that I could get to know TRACE from the ground up. I was 
able to simulate the Ganong effect (where top-down info resolves an ambiguous
phoneme).

**Limitations**: I didn't test any other phenomena, and it's too slow to be
useful.

My report on the package is in [vignettes/final_project](https://github.com/tjmahr/retrace/blob/master/vignettes/final_project.md).
