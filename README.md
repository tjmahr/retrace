retrace
=======

A pure R implementation of the TRACE model of word recognition (McClelland &
Elman, 1986). 

I wrote the package so that I could get to know TRACE from the ground up. I was 
able to simulate the Ganong effect (where top-down info resolves an ambiguous
phoneme).

**Limitations**: I didn't test any other phenomena, and it's too slow to be
useful.

My report on the package is in [vignettes/final_project](https://github.com/tjmahr/retrace/blob/master/vignettes/final_project.md).
